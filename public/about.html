<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a newbie at web develmopent but I came across a course on Udemy that was on sale for 80% off and so I decided to enroll.
  I have only ever created a website off of Squarespace, so I can definetly say I am inexperienced in coding and HTML but I was curious about what else I could learn.
  So far I have learned that creating websites takes a lot more than simply being creative. Learning that a website takes coding skills made me even
  more interested in the program then before. Hopefully I learn a new skill and create more than just websites in the future, maybe I'll be able to
  create a new app that people can use!

<p>A little more about me: I am 26 years old, my husband died in a motorcycle accident in 2024. I was going to go down the career path of X-ray technican but after the biggest loss of my life,
  my choices pivoted and I decided to learn new skills. I had initially worked with Squarespace to create simple websites
  and that was enough for me for awhile until I had a friend of mine show me a website called Udemy that was offering an end of year sale.
  the Web Development course was only $29.99. so I thought to myself, "why not? I wouldn't lose anything signing up" So far I have continously been 
  surprised by how little I knew of web development but instead of running away from the challenge I am embracing it. I hope that everyone is able to 
  learn a new skill if they are interested in computers and creating they should definetly check out Udemy. I am excited to see where it takes me.
