<h1>The Best TV Shows to Binge</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Shows of All Time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Squid Games</h3>
<p>
A Korean Show generally considered a psycological thriller
with elements of drama. Random people were approched
and invited to play a game to compete in a thrilling yet deadly children's game for a 
chance to win 45.6 billion won. It had me on the edge of my seat
because I never knew what would happen next. (10/10)

<h3>YOU</h3>
<p>
An American Show that is also considered a psycological
thriller. It's about a man that goes to extreme measures for love.
Even killing. The show just got better as it progressed. 
By the end of the third season you were questioning everthing,
it was like playing a murder mystery game. (10/10)

<h3>Arcane</h3> 
<p>
An Adult Drama that is an animated seires. It leans into the asthetic
that marries science fantasy and steampunk. It focuses on 
the fued between the rich city of Piltover and seedy underbelly
of Zaun and two sisters fighting on rival sides of the war.
The animation is spectacular, the storytelling is captivating
and the character development is beyond amazing. (12/10)
